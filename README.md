# Library Management System
## Description
This project focused on implementing a library management system using Python and SQL to handle various library functions such as member login, searching for books, borrowing books, returning books, and managing penalties.

### Group Work Breakdown
Our team divided the project into five main sections based on task size and complexity:
- Login Screen - Medium: Hunter 
- Member Profile - Small: Hunter
- Returning a Book - Large: Lynden
- Search for Books - Large: Jill
- Pay a Penalty - Small: Hunter

Additional tasks were shared by all group members:
  - Setting up the files for the project
  - Adding docstrings and comments
  - Testing edge cases

## Setup & Usage
To run the program, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory and use one of the following commands based on your system setup and database file:
- For systems using Python 3.x: "python3 main.py database" 
- If your database file has a '.db' extension: "python3 main.py database.db" 
- For systems using Python 2.x: "python main.py database"
- If your database file has a '.db' extension: "python main.py database.db"
