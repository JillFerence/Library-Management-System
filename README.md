Group member names and ccids (3-4 members)  
  hpullish, Hunter

# Group work break-down strategy
- First, we decided to break up the project into 5 sections
  1) Login Screen
  2) Member Profile
  3) Returning a Book
  4) Search for Books
  5) Pay a Penalty
- Second, we looked at the size and complexity of each section
  1) Login Screen: Medium 
  2) Member Profile: Small 
  3) Returning a Book: Large
  4) Search for Books: Large
  5) Pay a Penalty: Small
- Third, we divided up the tasks among the three of us to be relatively equal
  1) Login Screen: Hunter 
  2) Member Profile: Hunter 
  3) Returning a Book: Lynden
  4) Search for Books: Jill
  5) Pay a Penalty: Hunter
- Other tasks were shared by everyone at various stages of the project
  - Setting up the files for the project
  - Adding docstrings and comments
  - Testing edge cases
