# Library Management System
## Description
A library management system built with Python to handle various library functions. SQL is used to handle all essential database operations, including member login authentication, searching for books, borrowing books, returning books, tracking due dates, and managing penalties. The database is structured and maintained using SQL to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage, ensuring that the system operates smoothly and handles large datasets effectively.

### Group Work Breakdown
Our team divided the project into five main sections based on task size and complexity:
- Login Screen - Medium: Hunter 
- Member Profile - Small: Hunter
- Returning a Book - Large: Lynden
- Search for Books - Large: Jill
- Pay a Penalty - Small: Hunter

Additional tasks were shared by all group members:
  - Setting up the files for the project
  - Adding docstrings and comments
  - Testing edge cases

## Setup & Usage
To run the program, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory and use one of the following commands based on your system setup and database file:
- For systems using Python 3.x: "python3 main.py database" 
- If your database file has a '.db' extension: "python3 main.py database.db" 
- For systems using Python 2.x: "python main.py database"
- If your database file has a '.db' extension: "python main.py database.db"
